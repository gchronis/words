fetial
A fetial (Latin plural fetiales) was a type of priest in Ancient Rome. They formed a collegium devoted to Jupiter as the patron of good faith. The duties of the fetials included advising the senate on foreign affairs and international treaties, making formal proclamations of peace and of war, and confirming treaties.
